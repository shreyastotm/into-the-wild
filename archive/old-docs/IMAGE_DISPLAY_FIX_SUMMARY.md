# Image Display Fix Summary

## Problem

After editing a trek event and updating the image, the image was saving but not visible in:

1. The card in `/events` page
2. The "Details" section when clicking `/events/<trekid>`

## Root Cause

The application was using `image_url` column throughout the codebase, but we added an `image` column. The data was being saved to the `image` column but the application was still looking for `image_url`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Fix (`COMPLETE_IMAGE_FIX.sql`)

- Sync data between `image` and `image_url` columns
- Create a trigger to keep both columns in sync for future updates
- Verify the sync worked correctly

### 2. Application Code Updates

#### Updated Queries to Include Both Columns:

- `src/pages/TrekEvents.tsx` - Added `image` to select query
- `src/pages/admin/TrekEventsAdmin.tsx` - Added `image` to select query

#### Updated Image Display Logic:

- `src/hooks/trek/useTrekEventDetails.ts` - Use `data.image_url || data.image || null`
- `src/components/trek/TrekEventsList.tsx` - Use `trek.image_url || trek.image`

### 3. Files Modified

1. **`COMPLETE_IMAGE_FIX.sql`** - Database sync and trigger
2. **`src/pages/TrekEvents.tsx`** - Added `image` to select query
3. **`src/pages/admin/TrekEventsAdmin.tsx`** - Added `image` to select query
4. **`src/hooks/trek/useTrekEventDetails.ts`** - Fallback to `image` if `image_url` is null
5. **`src/components/trek/TrekEventsList.tsx`** - Fallback to `image` if `image_url` is null

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the Database Fix

Execute `COMPLETE_IMAGE_FIX.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor. This will:

- Sync existing data between `image` and `image_url` columns
- Create a trigger to keep them in sync for future updates
- Show verification results

### Step 2: Test the Application

1. Go to `/events` page - images should now be visible in the cards
2. Click on a trek event - images should be visible in the details section
3. Edit a trek event and update the image - it should save and display correctly

## Expected Results

- ✅ Images visible in `/events` page cards
- ✅ Images visible in trek event details pages
- ✅ New images save to both `image` and `image_url` columns automatically
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing `image_url` data

## Technical Details

The fix ensures that:

1. **Data Sync**: Existing data is copied between both columns
2. **Future Sync**: A database trigger keeps both columns in sync
3. **Application Fallback**: Code checks both columns and uses whichever has data
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `image_url` data continues to work

This approach ensures that images will be visible regardless of which column the data is stored in, and future updates will keep both columns synchronized.
