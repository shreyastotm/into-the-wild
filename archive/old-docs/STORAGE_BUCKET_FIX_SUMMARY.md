# Storage Bucket Fix Summary

## 🚨 Issue: "Bucket not found" Error

**Error**: `StorageApiError: Bucket not found` when uploading payment proofs

**Root Cause**: The `trek_assets` storage bucket doesn't exist in the production database, even though the migration files exist.

## 🔍 Analysis

### Code Usage

The application uses these storage buckets:

1. **`trek_assets`** - Used for payment proofs and trek images (public)
2. **`payment-proofs`** - Used for payment proofs (private)
3. **`avatars`** - Used for user avatars (public)
4. **`trek-images`** - Used for trek images (public)

### Migration Files Found

- `supabase/migrations/20250609120000_create_storage_bucket.sql` - Creates `trek_assets`
- `supabase/migrations/20250104000000_final_production_fixes.sql` - Creates other buckets
- `verify_and_fix_database.sql` - Creates all buckets

### Current Issue

The `trek_assets` bucket is missing from production, causing payment proof uploads to fail.

## ✅ Solution

### Step 1: Run the Storage Bucket Fix

Execute `FIX_STORAGE_BUCKETS.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor. This will:

1. **Create all required buckets**:
   - `trek_assets` (public) - for payment proofs and trek images
   - `payment-proofs` (private) - for payment proofs
   - `avatars` (public) - for user avatars
   - `trek-images` (public) - for trek images

2. **Set up proper RLS policies**:
   - Public read access for public buckets
   - User-specific access for private buckets
   - Admin access for payment proofs

3. **Verify bucket creation**:
   - Lists all created buckets
   - Shows all storage policies

### Step 2: Test the Fix

1. Try uploading a payment proof - should work without errors
2. Check that images display correctly
3. Verify file uploads work in all areas
