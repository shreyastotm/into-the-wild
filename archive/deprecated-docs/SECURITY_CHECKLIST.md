## üö® Critical Security Settings

### **Supabase Production Settings**

```sql
-- Ensure RLS is enabled on all tables
ALTER TABLE trek_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tent_requests ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ... etc for all tables
```

### **Environment Variables for Production**

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
VITE_APP_ENV=production
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
```

### **Vercel Environment Variables Setup**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add the following variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (your Supabase project URL)
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (your production anon key)
   - `VITE_APP_ENV` = `production`

## üõ°Ô∏è Ongoing Security Maintenance

### **Weekly Checks**

- [ ] Review error logs for security issues
- [ ] Check failed login attempts
- [ ] Monitor API usage patterns
- [ ] Review user permissions and roles

### **Monthly Checks**

- [ ] Update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys if needed
- [ ] Audit user accounts and permissions
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

### **Quarterly Checks**

- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing (if applicable)
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Update security headers and CSP policies

## üö´ What NOT to Do

### **Never Commit These to Git:**

- Production environment variables
- API keys or secrets
- User credentials
- Database connection strings
- Private keys or certificates

### **Never Log in Production:**

- User passwords
- Authentication tokens
- Credit card information
- Personal data (PII)
- Internal system details

## üìû Incident Response Plan

### **If Security Incident Detected:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Revoke compromised API keys
   - Change affected user passwords
   - Block suspicious IP addresses
   - Document the incident

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review logs for scope of breach
   - Identify affected data/users
   - Determine attack vector
   - Assess damage

3. **Recovery:**
   - Patch security vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups if needed
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Monitor for continued threats

4. **Communication:**
   - Notify affected users (if required)
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security procedures
   - File any required breach notifications

## üîç Security Testing Commands

```bash
# Check for hardcoded secrets
npm audit
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" src/ --exclude-dir=node_modules

# Check dependencies for vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Build and test production bundle
npm run build
npm run preview

# Test security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com
```
