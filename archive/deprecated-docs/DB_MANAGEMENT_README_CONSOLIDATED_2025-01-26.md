# üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Management System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive database schema management system for the Into The Wild trekking platform. The system provides automated schema management, migration consolidation, health checks, and synchronization between local and remote databases.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **DatabaseSchemaAgent** (`scripts/db-schema-agent.ts`) - Main automation agent
2. **Consolidated Migration** (`supabase/migrations/20260101000000_comprehensive_schema_consolidation.sql`) - Single source of truth
3. **Schema Extraction** (`scripts/extract_latest_schema.js`) - Current state capture
4. **Validation System** - Comprehensive health checks

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Automatic Migration Management** - Detects and applies pending migrations
- ‚úÖ **Conflict Resolution** - Automatically resolves local/remote disparities
- ‚úÖ **Schema Validation** - Comprehensive RLS and integrity checks
- ‚úÖ **Backup & Recovery** - Automated backup before major operations
- ‚úÖ **Health Monitoring** - Real-time database health assessment
- ‚úÖ **Consolidation** - Converts complex migration history into clean schema

## Quick Start

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Start local Supabase instance
npm run supabase:start

# Run full database setup (consolidates and syncs everything)
npm run db:full-setup

# Validate the setup
npm run db:validate
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Check database health
npm run db:health

# Sync with remote (if needed)
npm run db:sync

# Extract current schema for documentation
npm run db:extract-schema
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Create backup before deployment
npm run db:backup

# Sync local and remote databases
npm run db:prod-sync

# Validate production readiness
npm run db:validate
```

### Supabase CLI Commands

| Command | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `npm run supabase:start` | Start local Supabase instance | Development setup |
| `npm run supabase:stop` | Stop local Supabase instance | Cleanup |
| `npm run supabase:reset` | Reset local database | Fresh start |
| `npm run supabase:push` | Push migrations to remote | Deploy to production |
| `npm run supabase:pull` | Pull remote schema to local | Sync from production |

### Complete Workflows

| `npm run db:dev` | Start development with validation | Daily development |
| `npm run db:dev:reset` | Reset and sync development | After major changes |
| `npm run db:prod-sync` | Production synchronization | Before deployment |
| `npm run db:full-setup` | Complete setup from scratch | Initial setup or recovery |

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `users` | User profiles and authentication | Extended profile fields, RLS policies |
| `trek_events` | Trek event definitions | Complete lifecycle management |
| `trek_registrations` | User registrations for treks | Multi-step registration process |
| `trek_expenses` | Expense tracking | Fair sharing system |
| `notifications` | User notifications | Real-time and scheduled |
| `forum_*` | Community forum system | Categories, threads, posts, voting |

### Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- **Admin-only access** for sensitive operations
- **User isolation** - users only see their own data
- **Secure functions** with proper permissions

### Performance Features

- **Strategic indexes** on all foreign keys and search columns
- **Optimized queries** for common operations
- **Connection pooling** configuration
- **Efficient RLS policies**

## Migration Strategy

### Consolidation Process

1. **Archive Old Migrations** - Move conflicting migrations to archive
2. **Extract Current State** - Get actual database schema
3. **Create Consolidated Migration** - Single migration with all fixes
4. **Validate and Test** - Ensure everything works correctly
5. **Deploy** - Apply to production with confidence

### Conflict Resolution

The system automatically detects and resolves:
- **Local/Remote Drift** - Synchronizes migration status
- **Policy Conflicts** - Removes duplicate RLS policies
- **Schema Inconsistencies** - Standardizes table structures
- **Permission Issues** - Fixes access control problems

## Health Checks

The validation system checks:

### Schema Integrity
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Required indexes exist
- Foreign key constraints valid
- Data types consistent

### Security Validation
- RLS policies working correctly
- Admin functions accessible
- User permissions appropriate
- Storage policies configured

### Performance Metrics
- Query performance acceptable
- Indexes properly utilized
- Connection limits not exceeded
- Functions executing efficiently

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check Supabase status
npm run supabase:status

# Restart if needed
npm run supabase:stop && npm run supabase:start
```

#### Migration Conflicts
```bash
# Consolidate and start fresh
npm run db:consolidate
npm run db:dev:reset
```

#### RLS Policy Errors
```bash
# Validate and fix policies
npm run db:validate
npm run db:sync
```

#### Schema Drift
```bash
# Sync with remote
npm run db:sync
npm run db:extract-schema
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### Emergency Reset
```bash
# Complete reset and rebuild
npm run supabase:stop
npm run supabase:start
npm run db:full-setup
```

#### Production Recovery
```bash
# Backup, sync, validate
npm run db:backup
npm run db:prod-sync
npm run db:validate
```

## Monitoring

### Logs and Reports

- **Migration logs** stored in `database-schema/backups/`
- **Health reports** generated by validation commands
- **Schema extracts** in `database-schema/latest_schema.sql`
- **Backup files** timestamped and archived

### Performance Monitoring

- **Query performance** tracked in function execution
- **Connection usage** monitored via Supabase dashboard
- **Storage utilization** tracked for file uploads
- **RLS policy efficiency** validated automatically

## Best Practices

### Development
1. **Always validate** after schema changes
2. **Create backups** before major operations
3. **Test locally** before deploying to remote
4. **Use consolidated migrations** for complex changes

### Deployment
1. **Validate production** before deployment
2. **Create backups** of production data
3. **Test deployment** in staging first
4. **Monitor** after deployment completion

### Maintenance
1. **Regular health checks** with `npm run db:health`
2. **Schema extraction** after major changes
3. **Migration consolidation** when conflicts arise
4. **Backup verification** for critical data

## Integration with CI/CD

The system integrates with deployment pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Database Health Check
  run: npm run db:health

- name: Schema Validation
  run: npm run db:validate

- name: Production Sync
  run: npm run db:prod-sync
```

## Support
