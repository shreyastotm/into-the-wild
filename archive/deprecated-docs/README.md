## 2. Core Features & Workflows

This application seems to support several key functionalities:

- **User Authentication & Profiles:**
  - User signup (trekker, admin, micro-community partner) and login.
  - Profile management (bio, avatar, contact details, etc.).
  - Indemnity acceptance.
- **Trek Event Management:**
  - Creating, viewing, updating, and managing trek events (Implemented via a multi-step form in the admin panel for both creation and editing).
  - Details likely include name, description, category, difficulty, dates, location, cost/pricing, capacity, etc.
  - Trek Event Statuses & Basic Lifecycle: Admins can manage trek statuses (e.g., Draft, Upcoming, Open for Registration, Cancelled, Completed) which control visibility and registration availability (Implemented).
  - _(User: Describe the workflow for creating/managing a trek event.)_
- **Trek Discovery & Registration:**
  - Users can browse and search for available treks (Public listing filters out 'Draft' and 'Cancelled' treks).
  - Workflow for users to register for a trek:
    - Indemnity Acceptance: Users must accept indemnity terms before registering (Implemented).
    - Payment Proof: Users upload payment proof after initial registration (Implemented).
    - Admin Verification: Admins review payment proof and verify/complete the registration (Implemented).
    - Pickup location selection (Details to be confirmed).
  - _(User: Detail the trek discovery and registration process from a user's perspective.)_
- **Packing List Management:**
  - Generating and viewing packing lists for specific treks.
  - Distinguishing between mandatory and optional items.
  - _(User: Explain how packing lists are created, assigned, and used.)_
- **Expense Tracking & Splitting:**
  - Tracking expenses related to a trek.
  - Functionality for splitting expenses among participants.
  - Managing expense categories and potentially receipts.
  - _(User: Describe the expense submission and splitting workflow.)_

  - _(User: If this feature exists, describe how it works.)_

_(User: Add or remove features based on the actual scope of your application. Provide more detailed descriptions for each workflow.)_

## 3. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite) - _Correction: Previously noted Next.js, but project structure and `vite.config.ts` indicate Vite._
- **Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Package Management:** npm / bun (based on `package-lock.json` / `bun.lockb`)
- **Local Development:** Docker, Supabase CLI, Deno (for Edge Functions)

_(User: Verify and update this list as necessary.)_

## 4. Prerequisites for Development

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js) or bun
- Docker Desktop (running)
- Supabase CLI (Install/Update: `npm install supabase --global`)
- Deno (Install/Update: `irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex` on PowerShell, then restart terminal)

## 5. Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd into-the-wild
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR if using bun
    # bun install
    ```

3.  **Initialize Supabase Locally:**
    - Ensure your Supabase project is linked (if you haven't done this already from a previous setup):
      ```bash
      supabase login
      supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
      # Follow prompts to enter database password if needed.
      ```
    - Start the local Supabase services:
      ```bash
      supabase start
      ```
    - This will pull necessary Docker images and set up your local database, auth, storage, etc.
    - API URL, anon key, and other local Supabase details will be printed to the console. `supabase status` can be used to retrieve these later.
    - **Inbucket (Mail Catcher):** Access local emails (password resets, confirmations) via the Inbucket URL shown in `supabase status` (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:54324`).

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    - Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
    - Add the Supabase URL and anon key. For Vite projects, these must be prefixed with `VITE_`:
      ```env
      VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321 # Or your local Supabase API URL from 'supabase status'
      VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-local-supabase-anon-key-from-supabase-status>
      # Add any other required environment variables
      ```
    - **Important:** Restart your Vite development server after creating or changing `.env.local`.

5.  **Run Database Migrations & Seeding:**
    - The local database schema is set up by `supabase start` based on your `supabase/migrations` folder.
    - To ensure a clean state and apply all migrations (including the squashed schema and subsequent ones like notifications), and to populate data:
      ```bash
      supabase db reset
      ```
    - This command will also execute `supabase/seed.sql` if it exists. Create this file to populate your database with initial/test data (e.g., sample treks, users, categories). This is crucial after a reset to have data to work with.

6.  **Generate Supabase Types for Client:**
    - After any database schema changes (including adding RPCs), regenerate TypeScript types for your Supabase client:
      ```bash
      supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
      ```

7.  **Deploy Edge Functions Locally:**

    ```bash
    supabase functions deploy --no-verify-jwt
    ```

    - Ensure Deno is installed and in your PATH.
    - An `supabase/functions/import_map.json` is used to manage Deno dependencies.

8.  **Run the Development Server (Frontend):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # OR if using bun
    # bun run dev
    ```
    Your Vite application should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:8080` (or as specified in `vite.config.ts`).

## 6. Database Migrations

- Migrations are located in the `supabase/migrations` directory.
- The primary schema definition is `supabase/migrations/20250505155501_squashed_schema.sql`. Subsequent migrations (e.g., for notifications, RPCs) are applied in chronological order based on their filename timestamps.
- **Creating New Migrations:**
  - For schema changes, it's often best to make changes to your local database using Supabase Studio (accessible via `supabase status`, e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:54323`) or another database tool.
  - Then, diff the changes to create a new migration file:
    ```bash
    supabase db diff -f <migration_name>
    ```
  - Or, create an empty migration file and write SQL manually:
    ```bash
    supabase migration new <migration_name>
    ```
- **Applying Migrations:** Migrations are applied automatically during `supabase start` if they haven't been applied before. `supabase db reset` drops the local database, re-runs all migrations, and then runs `supabase/seed.sql`.

## 7. Edge Functions

- Edge Functions are located in the `supabase/functions` directory.
- Each function is a separate Deno module.
- **`signup-automation`:**
  - **Purpose:** Automates user onboarding tasks upon new user signup.
  - **Trigger:** Intended to be used with a Supabase Auth hook (e.g., `on_auth_user_created`).
  - **Actions:**
    - Updates `public.users` table with `user_type`, `partner_id`, indemnity status, verification status, etc.
    - Updates `auth.users.app_metadata` with `user_type` and `partner_id` for JWT claims.
  - **Dependencies:** Uses `@supabase/supabase-js` and `std/http/server.ts` via `supabase/functions/import_map.json`.
  - **Environment Variables (expected by the function, provided by Supabase runtime):**
    - `SUPABASE_URL`
    - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Deploying Locally:** `supabase functions deploy --no-verify-jwt`
- **Import Maps:** A shared `supabase/functions/import_map.json` is used. Consider per-function import maps for more complex projects.
