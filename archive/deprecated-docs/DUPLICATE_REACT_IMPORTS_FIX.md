# Duplicate React Imports Fix Report

## Summary
Fixed critical issue where 3 files had **duplicate React imports**, causing potential issues during module loading and compilation. This was a secondary code quality issue discovered after fixing the primary infinite loop bug.

## Root Cause
Some files had TWO separate React import statements:
1. First import: `import React, { useState, useEffect, ... } from "react";`
2. Second import: `import React, { Component } from "react";` (duplicate, unnecessary)

Having duplicate imports of the same module can cause:
- Module loading inconsistencies
- Increased bundle size
- Potential React instance conflicts
- ESLint warnings

## Files Fixed

### 1. **src/components/expenses/AddExpenseForm.tsx**
- **Issue:** Line 2 had the main React import, but line 37 (after other imports) had a duplicate
- **Fix:** Removed the duplicate import statement
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 2. **src/components/trek/create/CostsStep.tsx**
- **Issue:** Line 2 had the main React import, but line 18 had duplicate with `Component`
- **Fix:** Removed duplicate import on line 18
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 3. **src/components/trek/TentRental.tsx**
- **Issue:** Line 2 had the main React import with `useState, useEffect`, but line 17 had duplicate with `Component`
- **Fix:** Removed duplicate import on line 17
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

## Verification

### Build Test
```
✅ npm run build: SUCCESS
- 2369 modules transformed
- Built in 26.61s
- No compilation errors
```

### Local Testing
