# Into The Wild - Maintenance Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive maintenance procedures for the Into The Wild application, including code quality standards, testing procedures, and routine maintenance tasks.

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Standards
- Strict mode enabled for all files
- No `any` types allowed - use proper interfaces
- Generic types for reusable components
- Proper error type definitions and handling

### Component Standards
- Mobile-first responsive design (320px minimum width)
- Dark mode support for all components
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Component tests for complex UI logic
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows

## Maintenance Tasks

### Daily Tasks
- Monitor error logs
- Check performance metrics
- Review user feedback
- Verify database health

### Weekly Tasks
- Run full test suite
- Update dependencies with security patches
- Review security alerts
- Backup database
- Check API endpoint performance

### Monthly Tasks
- Performance audit
- Security audit
- Code quality review
- Documentation update
- Dependency major version updates

### Quarterly Tasks
- Architecture review
- Refactoring sprint
- Performance optimization
- User experience review

## Code Quality Agents

The project includes several automated code quality agents to help maintain high standards:

- Removes unused imports and dependencies
- Optimizes asset files (images, fonts, etc.)
- Cleans up redundant code patterns
- Generates cleanup reports

### 5. Architecture Improvement Agent
**Purpose:** Optimize folder structure and separation

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run architecture-optimize
```

**Capabilities:**
- Analyzes current folder structure
- Suggests improved organization patterns
- Separates frontend and backend code
- Optimizes import paths and dependencies
- Validates architecture compliance

### 6. Code Beautification Agent
**Purpose:** Format code and improve readability

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run beautify
```

**Capabilities:**
- Auto-formats all code files
- Organizes imports consistently
- Enforces naming conventions
- Improves code documentation
- Validates code readability metrics

## Performance Optimization

### Bundle Size Optimization
- Code splitting for vendor and feature chunks
- Lazy loading for all pages
- Image optimization with WebP format
- Tree shaking for unused code

### Rendering Optimization
- React.memo for expensive components
- useMemo and useCallback for optimization
- Virtualization for long lists
- Suspense for code splitting

### Network Optimization
- API response caching
- GraphQL query optimization
- Service worker for offline support
- Resource hints for faster loading

## Database Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Weekly backups
- Monthly vacuum analyze
- Quarterly index optimization
- Monitor query performance

### Migration Management
- Test migrations locally before applying to production
- Backup database before migrations
- Use transaction blocks for safety
- Document schema changes

## Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
