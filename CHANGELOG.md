### 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG FIX - DEPLOY v0.5.1**
**Resolved React context error #306 preventing Transport Tab access**

✅ **Root Cause Identified**: React Leaflet components require internal contexts that are lost during lazy loading
✅ **Fixed TravelCoordination**: Removed lazy loading and changed to direct import in both TrekEventDetails.tsx and AdminTrekDetails.tsx
✅ **Removed Suspense wrappers**: No longer needed since components are directly imported
✅ **Build tested**: Production build successful (47.45s, all assets generated correctly)

**Impact**: Transport Tab in events details page now works without React context errors. Users can access:
- Transport coordination and pickup location management
- Interactive maps with proper React Leaflet integration
- Driver assignment and passenger coordination
- Admin transport management tools
