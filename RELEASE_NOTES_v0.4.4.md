### Layout Structure
```typescript
// Before: Variable height with thumbnail grid
<div className="bg-card rounded-xl...">
  {/* Complex thumbnail grid causing height issues */}
  <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-1">
    {/* Multiple thumbnails + "+2" badge */}
  </div>
</div>

// After: Fixed height with clean layout
<div className="bg-card rounded-xl... h-[480px] flex flex-col">
  {/* Single image preview only */}
  <div className="relative h-56 w-full overflow-hidden flex-shrink-0">
    {/* Clean image display */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Key Improvements
