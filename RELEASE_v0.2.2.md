# Release v0.2.2 - Enhanced Payment Verification Workflow

**Release Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Version**: 0.2.2  
**Type**: Feature Enhancement

## 🚀 What's New

### Enhanced Payment Verification System
We've completely redesigned the payment verification workflow to handle real-world scenarios where the person making the payment may differ from the account holder.

### Key Features

#### 🎯 **Separate Registrant Details**
- **New Fields**: `registrant_name` and `registrant_phone` in trek registrations
- **Use Cases**: Parent paying for child, friend paying for group, payment from different phone number
- **Flexibility**: Captures actual payer details separately from account holder

#### 🔍 **Professional Admin Panel**
- **Payment Proof Modal**: Full-size image viewer (similar to ID verification)
- **Dual Information Display**: 
  - Account holder details (from user profile)
  - Actual payer details (from registration)
- **Required Workflow**: Admin must view payment proof before approving
- **Better UI**: Color-coded status badges, clear action buttons

#### 📝 **Improved Registration Form**
- **Pre-filled Fields**: Name and phone from user profile (editable)
- **Clear Labels**: "Payer's Name", "Payer's Phone" 
- **Validation**: All fields required before submission
- **User-Friendly**: Pre-fills reduce typing, allows editing for different payer

## 🛠️ Technical Changes

### Database Schema
```sql
-- New columns in trek_registrations table
ALTER TABLE public.trek_registrations 
  ADD COLUMN registrant_name VARCHAR(255),
  ADD COLUMN registrant_phone VARCHAR(20);
```

### Frontend Updates
- **RegistrationCard.tsx**: Added registrant fields with validation
- **useTrekRegistration.ts**: Enhanced to handle payer details
- **EventRegistrations.tsx**: Complete redesign with modal viewer
- **TrekEventDetails.tsx**: Updated function signatures

### Workflow Flow
```
User Registration → Payment Upload → Admin Review → Approval/Rejection
     ↓                    ↓              ↓              ↓
  Name/Phone        Payer Details    View Proof    Status Update
```

## 🎯 Real-World Scenarios Handled

### Scenario 1: Parent Pays for Child
- **Account**: Rahul Sharma (rahul@example.com)
- **Payer**: Ramesh Sharma (Father)
- **Solution**: Rahul registers, uploads proof with father's details

### Scenario 2: Group Registration
- **Multiple people register individually**
- **Same person pays for all**
- **Admin sees clear payer information for each**

### Scenario 3: Different Payment Number
- **Account phone**: 9988776655
- **Payment from**: 9876543210 (office/friend's number)
- **Solution**: Clear distinction between account and payment details
