## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Do I need to implement everything at once?
**A:** No! Follow the phased approach in `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`. Start with Phase 1 (foundation) and progress sequentially.

### Q: Can I change the color palette?
**A:** Yes, but ensure you maintain contrast ratios and update all references in the documentation.

### Q: What if I can't achieve a specific animation?
**A:** Start with CSS transitions (simpler), then move to CSS animations, and finally JavaScript-based animations if needed.

### Q: How do I handle logo file size?
**A:** Compress the logo (use TinyPNG or similar), convert to WebP format, and create multiple sizes for responsive loading.

### Q: What if the design doesn't work on mobile?
**A:** Follow the responsive patterns in `DESIGN_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` and test on real devices, not just emulators.

### Q: Can I skip accessibility testing?
**A:** No. Accessibility is not optional. Follow Phase 5.2 in `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`.

### Q: How do I contribute design improvements?
**A:** Document your changes, get design review, and update the relevant documentation files.

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Logo doesn't load
**Solution:** Check file path, ensure logo is in `public/` folder

**Issue:** Colors look different
**Solution:** Verify HSL values in `index.css`, clear browser cache

**Issue:** Animations are janky
**Solution:** Use `transform` and `opacity` only, check device performance

**Issue:** Text not readable
**Solution:** Check contrast ratios with WebAIM tool, adjust colors

**Issue:** Components not matching designs
**Solution:** Double-check specs in `UI_UX_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
