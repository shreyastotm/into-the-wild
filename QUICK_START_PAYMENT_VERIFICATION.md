# Quick Start: Payment Verification Workflow

## What Was Done

### ‚úÖ Problem Solved
- **Before**: Admin could verify payments without seeing proof, only user UUID shown (not user-friendly)
- **After**: Admin must view payment proof image before verification, sees user AND payer details

### ‚úÖ New Features
1. **Registrant Details Capture**: Name and phone of actual payer (can differ from account holder)
2. **Payment Proof Modal**: View full image before approving, similar to ID verification
3. **Better Admin UI**: Shows both account details and payer details side-by-side
4. **Workflow Validation**: Can't approve without payment proof being uploaded

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
In Supabase SQL Editor, execute:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20251008000000_add_registrant_details_to_trek_registrations.sql

BEGIN;

ALTER TABLE public.trek_registrations 
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS registrant_name VARCHAR(255),
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS registrant_phone VARCHAR(20);

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.trek_registrations.registrant_name IS 'Name of the person making the payment (may differ from user account name)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.trek_registrations.registrant_phone IS 'Phone number of the person making the payment (may differ from user account phone)';

UPDATE public.trek_registrations tr
SET 
  registrant_name = u.full_name,
  registrant_phone = u.phone_number
FROM public.users u
WHERE tr.user_id = u.user_id 
  AND tr.registrant_name IS NULL;

COMMIT;
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'trek_registrations' 
AND column_name IN ('registrant_name', 'registrant_phone');

-- Should return 2 rows
```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend
- All frontend changes are already in code
- Just deploy/restart your app
- No additional configuration needed

## How to Use

### For Admins

#### Access the Panel:
```
Navigate to: /admin/event-registrations
```

#### Verify a Payment:
1. **See the list** - Shows all registrations with status badges
2. **Click "Review"** on any "ProofUploaded" registration
3. **Modal opens** showing:
   - Left: User account details (full_name, email, phone)
   - Right: Payer details (registrant_name, registrant_phone)
   - Below: Full payment proof image
4. **Review the image** - Check if payment is valid
5. **Take action**:
   - Click "Approve Payment" (green) if valid
   - Enter reason and click "Reject" (red) if invalid

## Real-World Scenarios Handled

### Scenario 1: Parent Pays for Child
- **Account Holder**: Rahul Sharma (rahul@example.com, 9876543210)
- **Payer**: Ramesh Sharma (Father, 9123456789)
- **Solution**: 
  - Rahul registers with his account
  - Uploads payment proof with:
    - Payer Name: Ramesh Sharma
    - Payer Phone: 9123456789
  - Admin sees both details clearly

### Scenario 2: Group Registration
- **Account Holder**: Priya Singh
- **Payer**: Amit Singh (paying for 3 people)
- **Solution**:
  - Each person registers individually
  - All provide:
    - Payer Name: Amit Singh
    - Payer Phone: Same number
    - Their own payment proofs (or same proof)
  - Admin can reconcile easily

### Scenario 3: Different Payment Number
- **Account Holder**: Neha Patel (registered with 9988776655)
- **Payment Made From**: 9876543210 (office/friend's number)
- **Solution**:
  - Neha uploads proof with:
    - Payer Name: Neha Patel
    - Payer Phone: 9876543210
  - Admin sees both numbers, no confusion

## Testing Checklist

Before going live, test:

- [ ] **User Registration**: Name/phone fields work
- [ ] **Payment Upload**: All 3 fields required (name, phone, file)
- [ ] **Admin List**: Shows user and payer details
- [ ] **Payment Modal**: Image loads correctly
- [ ] **Approve**: Status changes to "Approved"
- [ ] **Reject**: Reason required, status changes to "Rejected"
- [ ] **Different Payer**: Enter different name/phone, verify admin sees both

## Troubleshooting

### "Column does not exist" error
**Fix**: Run the database migration in Step 1

### Can't see Dialog/Modal
**Fix**: Already included in codebase (`src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`)

### Payment proof not showing
**Fix**: 
1. Check storage bucket exists: `trek_assets`
2. Verify file uploaded successfully
3. Check browser console for errors

### RPC function errors
**Fix**: Already exist in `supabase/sql/registration_workflow.sql`
