# Vercel Project Configuration Issue

## Problem
You have two Vercel projects:
- `into-the-wild-ufij` (connected to intothewild.club domain) - OLD PROJECT
- `into-the-wild` (receiving new deployments) - NEW PROJECT

Your Git pushes are going to the NEW project, but your domain points to the OLD project.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update Domain Settings (RECOMMENDED)
Point your domain to the correct project:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/shreyas-projects-2f83efe9/into-the-wild-ufij/settings/domains
2. Remove the domain `intothewild.club` from this project
3. Go to: https://vercel.com/shreyas-projects-2f83efe9/into-the-wild/settings/domains
4. Add the domain `intothewild.club` to this project
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for DNS to propagate

### Option 2: Connect Git to the Old Project (ALTERNATIVE)
Update the old project to use the correct Git repository:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/shreyas-projects-2f83efe9/into-the-wild-ufij/settings/git
2. Disconnect the current repository
3. Connect to your correct GitHub repository: `shreyastotm/into-the-wild`
4. Set branch to `main`
5. Save settings
6. Go to Deployments and trigger a new deployment

### Option 3: Delete Old Project (CLEANEST)
If the old project is not needed:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/shreyas-projects-2f83efe9/into-the-wild-ufij/settings/advanced
2. Delete the project
3. Your domain will automatically fail over to the new project (if configured)
4. Or manually add the domain to the new project

## How to Check Current Status

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on "into-the-wild" project (without -ufij)
3. Check if you see commit `21770d3` in deployments
4. If yes, this is the correct project receiving updates

## Recommended Action

**Use Option 1**: Move the domain from the old project to the new one.

This is the cleanest solution and ensures all future deployments go to the right place.
