### Current Status: 🟡 Needs Cleanup Before Deploy

**Your codebase is 70% production-ready. Here's what needs to be done:**

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. ⚠️ **123 console.log statements** - Remove before production
2. ⚠️ **Duplicate type file** - Delete `types.tsnpx`
3. ⚠️ **Missing .env in .gitignore** - Security risk

### Time to Production Ready: **~6-8 hours**

## 🚀 Three Ways to Get Started

### Option 1: 🤖 Automated (Fastest)

**Windows Users:**
```powershell
.\scripts\pre-deploy-cleanup.ps1
```

./scripts/pre-deploy-cleanup.sh
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Creates backup of files to be deleted
- ✅ Removes duplicate files
- ✅ Cleans archive folders
- ✅ Reports console.log count
- ⚠️ Still requires manual console.log cleanup

**Time Required:** 30 minutes (including backup)
